This directory contains the macro for high content fcs. I have included
the macro file (.lvb)  and also exported each module in the .lvb file
as a basic (.bas) text file so they can be viewed and edited outside
of the Zeiss VBA macro editor.

The basic files are in the exported directory.

The file for the macro is called ***.lvb. This is the file to load
from the macro menu in AIM. When the VBA editor is opened the modules
in this file can be viewed. The macro starts with the Main() procedure
in Module1: when you click run on the macro menu, the Main() procedure
is launched.

Main() loads the form for the macro. Some of the controls on the form
are not needed (I don't like to delete things, just in case). To get
it to run, first click the "Mark Water" button that is near the buttom
of the form. Then click "Test Plate" and the macro will (hopefully) start.

The module rootInfo defines some global variables, but doesn't set any
of them.

The flow is as follows:
---
Main -> UserForm1
press "Test Plate" -> test_plate_scan (in modControl)
test_plate_scan -> scan_over_plate
scan_over_plate -> scan_in_well
scan_in_well -> ScanNewOverView in Module1
scan_in_well -> FindCells in Module 1

FindCells should call whatever external program you have to find cells
and report the positions.

FindCells -> testzoom (Module1)
testzoom -> takefcs (Module1)

testzoom also needs to call an external program to determine where to
take the measurement.

---

Each time the stageis moved to a new position, within a well or to a
different well, the procedure zautofocus is called to focus on the
cover slip. 

The function zfocusfcs is called prior to every zoomed up scan of a
cell.

Configurations are changed using the setTrack function.

Configuration must be set up before running the macro. As written,
three configurations with the following names are needed:
1) focus - to focus on the cover slip. We use reflected light with PMTs
to do this.
2) overviewscan - to take the scan of the entire field of view.
3) zoomscan - setting to take close-ups of cells. Using APDs.

The code is written to detect when a configuration is using the
APDs. If the APDs are in the path,the AOTF maximum power is reduced to
10%.
